# Biological-Simulation-SIR-Model
Biological Simulation of Infection Disease Transmission (SIR Model)
Python project using CoCalc software to simulate infectious disease spread using the SIR model. Implemented the SIR model using scipy.integrate.odeint and calculated equilibrium points and the Jacobian matrix for stability analysis. Project showcases proficiency in Python, differential equations, numerical methods, and data analysis for real-world problems in epidemiology.
